========

- Add the possibility to track changes between more than one directory
- Make benchmarks
- Move to cElementTree
- Different strategies for detecting changes :
  - From signature
  - From "tags" (size, etc...)
  - By comparing actual files in real time (implies that the nodestate can be
	extracted directly from the FS).

Compare
=======

>	sink compare Sources/python Build/ 
>	18    [+] lambdafactory/pnuts.pyc
>	19 [=][<] lambdafactory/python.py
>	20    [+] lambdafactory/python.pyc
>	21    [+] lambdafactory/reporter.pyc

>	sink compare -pick=19:1 Sources/python Build
>	sink compare -update=19 Sources/python/Build
>	sink compare -keep=19   Sources/python/Build

Tracking
========

	- Add content filtering when in SHA mode (normalize spaces for instance)
	- Add filters
	- Module to plug diff/rsync to speed up the whole process of detecting what
	  has changed.
	- Replace walknodestate by iteartor
	- Use the Set module instead of the set function, test which one is faster
	- Created => Added, Modified => Changed ?
	- Don't remember why child nodes have to be canonically sorted... this takes
	  unnecessary time
