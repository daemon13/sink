Tracking
========

	- Add filters
	- Module to plug diff/rsync to speed up the whole process of detecting what
	  has changed.
	- Cut the fat of the node state objects, and investigate the possibility to
	  store them in a lightweight, fast database.
	- Make a filesystem interaface that allows to plug-in other backends
	- Maybe get rid of the XML output... thought I'm not sure
	- Replace walknodestate by iteartor
	- Use the Set module instead of the set function, test which one is faster
	- Created => Added, Modified => Changed ?
	- Don't remember why child nodes have to be canonically sorted... this takes
	  unnecessary time
