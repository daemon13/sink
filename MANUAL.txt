Linking mode
============

  Goal::

    Make it easy to compose a project with files coming from different projects
    (which can be your own projects, or other projects, open-source projects,
    etc).

  Typical example::

    - You have a JavaScript widgets library.
    - You have basic JavaScript utility libraries.
    - You have one project that makes use of both.

  Usual solution::

    - Making symlinks

  The problem::

    - Not well supported by SCM (Mercurial, SVN, etc)
    - Not very portable (Windows, different file system layouts)
    - Doesn't allow the project to be self-contained

  Sink links::

    - Links without using symlinks
    - Portable, intergrates well with any SCM, the project is self-contained
    - Makes it easy to synchronize back and forth (your link can be out of date)

  Usage
  -----

  1) Create a new link DB
     |
     >    sink link init

  2) Add links to your project
     |
     >    sink link add $PROJECTS/mercurial/... imported/commands.py
     >    sink link add $PROJECTS/mercurial/... imported/other.py

  3) Monitor your links
     |
     >    sink link status

  4) Update your links
     |
     >    sink link update

  5) Merge back local changes 
     |
     >    sink link merge

  6) Remove links
     |
     >    sink link remove
